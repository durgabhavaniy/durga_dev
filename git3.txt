Branching in GIT
====================
We can create multiple branches and work on them seperately
Eg: a developer creates a seperate branch for every sprint
sprint1 sprint2 sprint3 etc and work on them seperately
Later he can connect with the master branch and merge it

By default the control of git is on the mster branch

To find the list of all available branches
git branch
To find list of all branches(local and remote)
git branch -a
To create a branch
git branch branchname
To move into  a branch
git checkout branchname
To merge a branch with the master branch
1 checkout to the master branch
  git checkout master
  git merge branchname
To delete a branch
  git branch -d branchname
To delete a remote branch
  git branch -dr branchname


git clone
git fetch 
git pull


git clone will download the complete repository
from the git hub.It will also create a .git folder
ie it initilizes the pwd as a git repository

Syntax
     git clone git_remote_repo_url
To find the remote remo url
1 open github.com
2 login into our account
3 click on repositories
4 clcik on the repo that should be downloaded
5 click on "Clone or Download"
6 copy the url
7 use it with the above git clone command

git fetch will download only the modified files and
it will store on a remote branch..we should checout to that
branch and see the modifications...once we are satisified
with the changes we can merge this remote branch with master
branch
Modify some file on the github
1 git fetch
2 git branch -a
3 git checkout remote_branch_name
4 we will find those changes in the file present in the
  remote branch but the same file on master branch
  will not ahve those changes
5 to merge this remote branch with master branch
  checkout to master branch
   git checkout master
   git merge remote_branch_name

git pull will download the changes and automatically
merge with master branch
Syntax: git pull
