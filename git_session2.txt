Working directory: is the default folder where the developer
   create his code.The files present in working directory
   initially are called untracked files...ie git has no
   access on those files

   initially sent.

Git local repository:From the stagging area files are 
   commited into LR where version controlling is done

=================
If we want some files to be totally ignored by git
we can place their names in a hidden file called
.gitignore

 cat > .gitignore

if we file git status command it will not list
file1,file2,file3 either in stagging section or in
untracked files section
